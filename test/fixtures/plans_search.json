But because we don't know the exact date we're sticking with Dec 25th, okay?. I know also the history behind how Christmas came about and the pagan festival before it, but we're not focusing on the origins we're focusing on the Saviour coming to earth to live amongst us. And I know that the Bible doesn't strictly tell us to celebrate Jesus Birthday, but I've had one this year so I guess it would be rude not to have one for Jesus (Besides that, the Queen of England has two Birthdays, so how much more should the King of Kings have one!). And I also know we should celebrate him every day, but God loves special occasions (the Bible is full of them), so this is not a one off only annual celebration, but a special focal point for Christians to celebrate his coming (see note below). And finally, I know that most historians agree that the date of Jesus' birth was more than likely a few years BC, but does it really matter how old he is? Let's keep the main thing the main thing and celebrate the arival of Jesus on the Earthly scene! :)\n\nMESSAGE ABOUT THE COMING OF JESUS\n-------------------------------------------------\nJust over two thousand years ago a baby boy was born. He changed the lives of so many. Even today, over two billion people claim to follow him. A book based on and around him was put into print a few hundred years ago and consistently ranks as the world's best-seller. His name is Jesus. So significant was his birth, that every new day we enter into is a pointer back to that day.\n\nEven though he was still God (the Son), why did he give up all his heavenly privileges and go so low as to become a human being and come and live on this Earth?\n\n\u2022 HE CAME AS A LIGHT (John 12:46). No one anymore has to be left fumbling around in the darkness of disillusionment, despair or doubt.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME AS LIVING BREAD (John 6:35). Bread sustains our natural bodies, but the bread that Jesus offers sustained our spirits forever.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME AS A SERVANT. Not to do his will, but to do the will of his Father in heaven (John 6:38). What an example! Even in his power and might, he modeled servanthood and obedience to us, living a life perfectly in time with the heart beat of his Father.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME TO DIVIDE (John 10:34). There are no grey areas with Jesus. You're either on his side or on the other side.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME TO FULFIL (matt 5:17)! There was much debate about the religious laws laid down by Moses. Jesus was not moving the Old Testament goalposts, he merely came to score a New Testament goal.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME TO SAVE SINNERS (1 Tim 1:15). That means me, you and everybody else who ha s ever lived or who is living today. His name actually means 'He Saves'. He may have been a carpenter by trade, but he operated in the business of saving lives from the penalty of sin - death.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME WITH AN INVITATION for us to turn our lives inside out (Mark 2:17). He didn't address those who thought they were spiritually-fit, but went out inviting ones who knew they were sin-sick.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME AS A RANSOM (Matt 20:28). He gave away his life in exchange for the many who are held captive to sin. He paid the ultimate price to see multitudes set free without having to pay a penny themselves.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME TO DIE (John 12:27). Every single moment of Jesus' 33 years on this earth was pointing to hour of his death. If he hadn't have died, then we wouldn't be able to live out the life we were originally created to live before sin ruined it all.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME AS KING to rule and reign for evermore (John 18:37). No political spin or dictatorship involved. He just came to proclaim the truth and said it as it is.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME TO DESTROY THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL (1 John 3:8). Sin and sickness, poverty and strife, death and everything else that stands against the people of God have all been dealt with at the cross where Jesus died. The devil has been disarmed.\n\n\u2022 HE CAME SO THAT WE COULD LIVE LIFE TO THE MAX (John 10:10). None of this \u2018half empty - half full\u2019 stuff. Believers of Christ can experience not only a full quota of life, but a life that overflows into others'.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm just glad that I can fully celebrate Jesus\u2019 life and join the birthday celebrations again this year.\n\nWhether you've accepted the invitation before or you are accepting it for the first time, if you want to nail your colours to the mast then press the accept button below.\n\nShare the love - invite all your friends too! :) Let\u2019s see how many people we can get to this awesome event!","is_attending":0,"attendees_count":4,"attendees":null,"comments_count":0,"comments":null},{"plan_url":"http:\/\/plancast.com\/p\/64r","plan_id":"64r","plan_created_at":"Mon Jan 18 07:37:23 +0000 2010","plan_created_since":"4 months","creator":[],"text":null,"what":"FeZ Summer Night Dream Party 15 ","when":"June 5-6, 2010, 11-11:00am","where":"Batha Museum - BARBARY OAK","place":null,"start":1275735600,"stop":1275822000,"external_url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/event.php?eid=59069365879","description":"FeZ Summer Night Dream Party Saturday June 5th 2010 with Loreena McKennitt the star in FeZ blue sky this year!\n\nTheme of this year is inspired by the BARBARY OAK in the magic Andalusian gardens of the Batha Museum.\nOur Networking meetings are as usual all free...You pay for what you choose to spend! \n\nSpecial Registration Conditions Apply for Loreena Mc Kenitt concert at 8 pm in Bab Makina  \n+212661092888 \n+447509208610\n\nFree concerts at dusk - Boujloud Place\n\nA Place of Pilgrimage for Musicians and Music Lovers\n\n Fes is a global music destination.

We need our History told more than just for a month, we want our history told to our children in the school system, in the community, within the family system, not with shame, but with pride, as we move into the GLOBAL COMMUNITY.  \n\n-We want to work toward seeing more positive images of Black women, and communities in general in more positive light.  \n\n-We not only want to focus on the \"negatives that are going on in our communities for social service organizations to get funding to help our communities, we want to also see the results taking place from the funding\".\n\n-We want to advocate more for dollars being channeled into our communities, that will support small business creation for Black women and their families.  Opportunities to circulate our dollars more into our communities, helping to sustain ourselves.\n\n-We want to address the situation with \"gang violence\" that is taking place in our communities.\n\nWe want our voices heard on Capital Hill, that we are not proponents of high taxation, either,  however, we are in need of a supportive ways of ensuring that our children get the best health care and education that will support the creation of productive citizens in America.  \n\nWe want to have our voices heard loud and clear that Blacks since 1619 played an intricate role in helping to build what we now know as AMERICA, where families have come from all parts of the world to experience the freedom and liberty that America has been the gateway for people to experience from all over the world.  We are not just people that are receiving \"hand outs\", we have been people that have been the core of giving all people a \"hand up\" in reaching their tree of life in every area of American life.  We too, want America to work for all people, however, we do not want ourselves or our future generation to be left out of the equation.\n\nWe want to have our voices heard that WE TOO, CONTINUE TO STAND FOR JUSTICE AND PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS FOR ALL PEOPLE!\n\nWe want our voices heard that we want the very best for all families in America, no one should be left out.
