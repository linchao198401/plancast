TechCrunch is coming, and we\u2019re bringing three days of non-stop conference and startup-competition energy, May 24-26.\n\nWe call it TechCrunch Disrupt because we want to debate what\u2019s really changing in media and technology right now, what\u2019s causing disruption and what we need to do about it to survive and thrive in real time.\n\nEach morning, we\u2019ll explore media and technology disruption themes through hosted panel discussions, keynotes, roundtable conversations and select product demonstrations. We\u2019ll bring the experts, thought leaders, top entrepreneurs and business leaders and others together to talk about what\u2019s next. And why. With lots of audience participation.\n\nEach afternoon, we take our morning debate into the field. New startups and products will be unveiled and will compete for recognition and a top prize in the Startup Battlefield.\n\nThis is a tournament-style launch platform where startups demo their products and impress the audience and panel of experts over multiple rounds of competition. Everyone gets stage time to show their stuff, and plenty of direct feedback. But then they\u2019ll jump into head to head competition with the other startups.\n\nExperts and seasoned veterans will be brought in to mentor and judge startups on product, business models, team, design and usability and more. And the final round will put startups in the hot seat where some of the most successful entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and business executives will grill them in front of the audience and see how they perform. It\u2019ll be a little bit like pitching a top VC, except it will be done live on stage in front of thousands. Audience voting as well as expert feedback will factor into final competition scores.\n\nOne startup will emerge the overall winner and take home a $50,000 cash prize. But all of the startups get an incredible launch event for their product, and priceless feedback from people who can really help. And, best of all, it\u2019s free for startups to launch at TechCrunch Disrupt. Save those dollars for your product.\n\nApplications open today (March 1) and will be reviewed on a rolling basis through midnight pst, Friday, March 26. There are no fees to apply or compete in the Startup Battlefield, and startups from around the world are welcome to submit for consideration. In fact, we go out of our way to take help non-U.S. startups get the support they need during the application process to maximize their chances.\n\nWhere can you fit a battlefield in New York City, you ask? We found 100,000 square feet of space in the Soho-West Village neighborhood. We promise you haven\u2019t been to a conference venue like this before. It\u2019s actually an ex-Merrill Lynch office that\u2019s available on short-term lease. It\u2019s a perfect metaphor for disruption. And it gives us almost unlimited room for creativity, exhibits, lounges and demos. In typical TechCrunch style, save room for the after parties each night too.\n\nTickets to TechCrunch Disrupt are on sale now. Best rates are available through March 31.\n\nBetter to disrupt than be disrupted. Hope to see you there. More details will be coming on the Disrupt Blog.","is_attending":0,"attendees_count":144,"attendees":[{"id":2556,"name":"Buddy

In 2008 we added an eco-zone to the event where we reserved two blocks of the six block Festival for green exhibitors, businesses and educational displays.\n\nThis year the east entrance of the Festival, (beginning at Gough) will again feature arts and crafts created with recycled and sustainable materials and eco-friendly exhibits. Additionally, the Festival showcases 150 arts & crafts booths, 25 gourmet food booths, two stages of live entertainment and bistro style cafes.\n\nSan Francisco is a forward thinking city and the Union Street Festival with its eco-urban theme helps promote the value of Green thinking in all aspects of our day to day lives.\n\nThe Festival is held on San Francisco's fashionable Union Street where historic Victorians have been transformed into popular boutiques, art galleries and restaurants. Over 100 staff members are on-site to assist exhibitors and the public. Parking is available three blocks from the event site.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.unionstreetfestival.com\/\nhttp:\/\/www.unionstreetsf.com\/","is_attending":0,"attendees_count":18,"attendees":[{"id":247,"name":"Jonathan
